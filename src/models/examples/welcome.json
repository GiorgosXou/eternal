The relationships between computation, thinking, and perception are moving from metaphorical to formal. Art has always been the process of encoding a mental representation into an artifact. The artifact here is a program which allows one to describe a sub-program, encoded as a computational graph that might reflect a mental representation in your bio-mind. \n\nWhat I am interested in here is ~music eternal~... non-halting computational acoustic processes. What I want is ~music eternal~.\n\n--\n\nScience to me seems to be subsumed by art. It is done for its own sake, out of an unjustifiable cause in service to some kind of aesthetic beauty. It is something one embarks on without hope of success; it is attempting to compute Solomonoff inference, knowing beforehand that it is both uncomputable and also proveably perfect.\n\n-- \n\npress \"shift + /\" (the question mark) for the menu.\n\nmake your computer compute eternal programs, or load some that i've made."},"title":"README"}],"edges":[]}
