Complex phenomena which are beautiful but also succinctly describable have beauty in both perceptual and abstract senses. This project is one which allows one to describe audio/visual processes as programs, encoded as a visual graph. You can think of it as an extension of Sol LeWitt's process art or Brian Eno's idea of \"music as gardening\".\n\n--\n\nScience to me seems to be subsumed by art. It is done for its own sake, out of an unjustifiable cause in service to some kind of aesthetic beauty. It is something one embarks on without hope of success; it is attempting to compute Solomonoff inference, knowing beforehand that it is both uncomputable and also proveably perfect.\n\n-- \n\nmost actions are invoked via keyboard commands. press \"shift + /\" (the question mark) for the menu.\n\nconnect nodes and edges to make your computer compute eternal programs, or load some that i've made."},"title":"README"}],"edges":[]}
