<p align="center">ðŸ‘¾ welcome to the eternal ðŸ‘¾</p>

i don't like to explain myself, but here it is useful; for you, i will try. This project was created for gratuitous reasons; itâ€™s an attempt to serve an aesthetic that I appreciate, over a medium which I feel is appropriate for its expression. The computationalist perspective is one which I see emerging in our society. The relationships between computation, thinking, and perception are moving from metaphorical âžœ formal. Art has always been the process of encoding a mental representation into an artifact. The artifact here is a program which allows the description and decision of a sub-program, encoded as a computational graph, intended to allow transcriptions of a mental representation for your bio-minds.

#### Myths on the Examples

There are several example graphs that can be loaded from within the app itself. `cmd + e` on a mac and `ctrl + e` on windows:

###### nude, eternally
This is radiohead, forever. `Thom Yorke` eternally over `EMaj7 - AMaj9 - G#m7`. Don't get any big ideas, though; indeterminate but not infinite. An irreducible arpeggio, in 78 nodes.

###### in the gardens of eden
Et in Arcadia, eno. [`Brian`](https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners) plants his seeds as he thinks of Aristotle's `prime mover`. Against the `C`s of entropy, `Terry Riley`'s decomposing soul fertilizes our lilies.  

###### platonic plague
man, i fold<br>
to the realm of forms<br>
man, i fold<br>
to fi del it y

###### the music while the music lasts
i do not know much about gods; but i think that the river<br>
Is a strong brown god - sullen, untamed and intractable<br>
they sing in the silence of space

###### stephen wolfram
Stephen Wolfram is an operator that, when given a 1D cellular automata rule number [0-255] and a representation of the world, outputs the subsequent state of the world according to that rule. He will do this indefinitely and is, in fact, Earth's first eternal human.

###### shaders
sisyphus walks the color tensor, in `YUV`

###### etc...
and so on, until the ends.

#### Development

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes

`yarn deploy`

Run the gh-pages deploy script
