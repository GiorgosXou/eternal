i don't like to explain myself, but here it is useful; for you, i will try. This project was created for gratuitous reasons; itâ€™s an attempt to serve an aesthetic that I appreciate, over a medium which I feel is appropriate for its expression. The computationalist perspective is one which I see emerging in our society. The relationships between computation, thinking, and perception are moving from metaphorical âžœ formal. Art has always been the process of encoding a mental representation into an artifact. The artifact here is a program which allows the description and decision of a sub-program, encoded as a computational graph, intended to allow transcriptions of a mental representation for your bio-minds.

what i am interested in here is

non-halting-computational-acoustic processes 
What i want is 
~music eternal~

There are several example graphs that can be loaded from within the app itself. `cmd + e` on a mac and `ctrl + e` on windows; you may need to zoom out to fit some graphs `cmd + -`:

###### [nude, eternally](https://kousun12.github.io/eternal?e=nude%2C%20eternally)
This is radiohead, forever. `Thom Yorke` eternally over `EMaj7 - AMaj9 - G#m7`. Don't get any big ideas, though; indeterminate but not infinite. An irreducible arpeggio, in 78 nodes.

###### [in the gardens of eden](https://kousun12.github.io/eternal?e=in%20the%20gardens%20of%20eden)
Et in Arcadia, eno. [`Brian`](https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners) plants his seeds as he thinks of Aristotle's `prime mover`. Against the `C`s of entropy, `Terry Riley`'s decomposing soul fertilizes our lilies.  

###### [platonic plague](https://kousun12.github.io/eternal?e=platonic%20plague)
man, i fold<br>
to the realm of forms<br>
man, i fold<br>
to fi del it y

###### [the music while the music lasts](https://kousun12.github.io/eternal?e=the%20music%20while%20the%20music%20lasts)
i do not know much about gods; but i think that the river<br>
Is a strong brown god - sullen, untamed and intractable<br>
they sing in the silence of space

###### [stephen wolfram](https://kousun12.github.io/eternal?e=)
Stephen Wolfram is an operator that, when given a 1D cellular automata rule number [0-255] and a representation of the world, outputs the subsequent state of the world according to that rule. He will do this indefinitely and is, in fact, Earth's first eternal human.

###### [shaders](https://kousun12.github.io/eternal?e=shaders)
sisyphus walks the color tensor, in `YUV`

###### etc...
and so on, until the ends.

#### Development
While this might smell something like consumer software, you should understand it as an art project. While I believe that there's a space for something like this (a flow-based-programming inspired audio / visual creative tool), this has been made only as an aesthetic exploration; I don't intend to support it in any way, but you should feel at liberty to do with it what you please.

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes

`yarn deploy`

Run the gh-pages deploy script
