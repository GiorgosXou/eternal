ðŸ‘¾ welcome to the eternal ðŸ‘¾

This project was created for gratuitous reasons; itâ€™s an attempt to serve an aesthetic that I appreciate, over a medium which I feel is appropriate for its expression.

The computationalist perspective is one which I see emerging in our society. The relationships between computation, thinking, and perception are moving from metaphorical to formal. Art has always been the process of encoding a mental representation into an artifact. The artifact here is a program which allows one to describe a sub-program, encoded as a computational graph that might reflect a mental representation in your bio-mind. 

What I am interested in here is \~music eternal\~... non-halting computational acoustic processes. What I want is \~music eternal\~.
